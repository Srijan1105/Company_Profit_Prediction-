# 📈 Company Profit Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning models to predict a company's annual profit based on various features like R&D Spend, Marketing Spend, Administration Costs, Employee Count, and State location.

## 🔍 Overview

Predicting business profit is a key part of financial forecasting and strategic planning. In this project, we generate a synthetic dataset and use regression models to build and evaluate predictive systems.
